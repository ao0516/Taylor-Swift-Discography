### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to see what factors are important when trying to produce a popular song. Taylor Swift is a very successful artist, so I'm using her music to see what she does to create such hits.

### Research Question & Hypothesis
**Research Question:** What variables within a song in Taylor Swiftâ€™s discography lead to a high amount of streams on Spotify?

**Hypothesis:** I expect that danceability, energy, tempo and key will all play a significant role in high stream count.


### Data
The data used was scraped from Spotify, Lyric Genius, and Billboard to create this dataset. It includes all of Taylor's albums, lyrics, tempo, speechness, acousticness, key, loudness, streams, and more.

### Code
There is only one rmd file which includes all code completed during analysis. I used summary statistics, linear regressions, logistic regressions, ANOVA, Tukey tests, and Decision trees when analyzing the discography. I used RStudio to complete this analysis. 

### Findings
In summary, the analysis revealed several significant predictors of high stream counts within Taylor Swift's music catalog. These included variables such as energy and speechiness, where songs with a dynamic and engaging vibe tended to attract more streams. Additionally, track number emerged as a crucial factor, with earlier tracks within albums or albums as a whole demonstrating higher stream counts, suggesting potential listener preferences for familiarity or promotional efforts.
