### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to see what factors are important when trying to produce a popular song. Taylor Swift is a very successful artist, so I'm using her music to see what she does to create such hits.

### Data
The data used was scraped from Spotify, Lyric Genius, and Billboard to create this dataset. It includes all of Taylor's albums, lyrics, tempo, speechness, acousticness, key, loudness, streams, and more.

### Code
There is one code file as of now. I will be creating models, running basic statisitcs, and breaking the data up within this file. I'm using RStudio to complete this analysis. 

### Findings
Will be added once analysis is complete!
